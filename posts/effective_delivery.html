                <h1>Effective Delivery</h1>
                <h6>17th August 2015 - Chris Meek</h6>
                <p>Our Effective Delivery process focuses on what is most important to your project; delivering real value to your business and clients as quickly as possible. We do this by relying on our experience of lean, agile and empirical techniques giving you complete visibility and control over your project. This is combined with an unwavering commitment to quality and software design produces products that;</p>
<ul>
<li>Realise value as early as possible</li>
<li>are adaptable to rapidly changing business goals</li>
<li>cheaper to maintain</li>
<li>easy to use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>We like to start our engagements with an informal meeting to discuss your project&#39;s needs and how you hope it will help your business both in the short and longer term. Our commitment to understanding you company and it&#39;s goals is what underpins the success of our projects.</p>
<p>Most of our engagements will follow with a number of story mapping sessions. Story mapping is a technique we use to discover the users of the system, their activities and the tasks they perform in their daily work. By focussing on the people the system is intended to help we ensure the software enhances their ability to get work done.</p>
<p>Once in development we deliver each feature through to production servers meaning you see real working software in a live environment from the very beginning of the project. No nasty surprises after a long and hidden development effort.</p>
<p>Internally our developers focus on the business value they are delivering alongside adherence to the very best technical standards. Every new feature passes through the following process to ensure quality delivery.</p>
<ul>
<li>The feature is reviewed by the team to ensure it is well understood</li>
<li>Features are usually worked on by pairs of developers; ensuring high quality output</li>
<li>The feature is internally reviewed by the team</li>
<li>The feature is released to a staging environment</li>
<li>You are able to use the new feature and decide to promote it to the live software</li>
</ul>
<p>Because each feature is handled independently you can start using your software from the point the first feature is delivered. The software will the grow from here, allowing you to steer the software in the desired direction based on the experience of real world usage of the product.</p>
