			<h1>Your Software Simplification Partners</h1>

			<p>We are evolutionary architects and have assisted many clients make organisational scale technical changes moving towards small, simple, independent, robust distributed services that are easy to deploy.  Our favoured approach is based on embedded expertise over documentary instruction. We focus closely on strategic technical decision making whilst working within teams to implement them in parallel with delivering product features.</p>
				
			<p>The reason we are successful is that we have learned how to ensure techinical changes progress in line with business priorities.  We develop a mindset where technical changes are not so big that they bring throughput to a halt but neither so small that they have no meaningful impact.</p>
