        <h3>Embedded Expertise</h3>
        <p>Unlike many agencies, we don't simply dictate best practices and leave. We work directly within your teams, gaining first-hand experience of the problems and implementing practical solutions.</p>
        <p>With 50 years of combined experience across diverse industries including BT, BBC, ITV, Just Eat, and VW Bank, we bring proven expertise to your specific challenges.</p>

        <h3>Evolutionary Architecture</h3>
        <p>We help organisations make organisational-scale technical changes, moving towards small, simple, independent, and robust distributed services that are easy to deploy.</p>
        <p>Our approach ensures that technical changes progress in line with business priorities - not so big that they halt throughput, but impactful enough to make a meaningful difference.</p>
